    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return max;
    }

    int helper(TreeNode root){
        if(root == null) return 0;
        // maxing with 0 bcz we may not include that path sum if it is -ve.
        int l = Math.max(0,helper(root.left));
        int r = Math.max(0,helper(root.right));
       // curr goes to higher recursion or nodes as a path sum
       // which includes max sum b/w left and right subtree
        int curr = root.val + Math.max(l,r);
       // max gets updated for every node
