What is meant by the term OOPs?
OOPs refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is the programming model or paradigm that is defined around objects.
Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities, that have some characteristics and behaviours.

What is the need for OOPs?
There are many reasons why OOPs are mostly preferred, but the most important among them are:
OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they don’t know the actual implementation.
With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.
Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.

What are some other programming paradigms other than OOPs?
Procedural Programming Paradigm: It specifies the steps a program must take to reach the desired state, usually read in order from top to bottom.
Functional Programming Paradigm: Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

What are the main features of OOPs?
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Data Abstraction

What are some advantages of using OOPs?
OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.
Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.
OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.
OOPs also helps to hide unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.

What is a class?
A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member,
and some set of rules, known as behaviours or functions. 

What is an object?
An object refers to the instance of the class, which contains the instance of the members and behaviours defined in the class template.

What is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods of a program together to do a specific job, without revealing unnecessary details.
Encapsulation can also be defined in two different ways:
1) Data hiding: Encapsulation is the process of hiding unwanted information, such as restricting access to any member of an object.
2) Data binding: Encapsulation is the process of binding the data members and the methods together as a whole, as a class.

What is Polymorphism?
In OOPs, Polymorphism refers to the process by which some code, data, method, or object behaves differently under different circumstances or contexts. 
There are two types of polymorphisms in OOPs languages.

Static Polymorphism: Static Polymorphism is commonly known as the Compile time polymorphism. 
It is the feature by which an object is linked with the respective function or operator based on the values during the compile time. 
Static or Compile time Polymorphism can be achieved through Method overloading or operator overloading.

Runtime Polymorphism: Dynamic or Runtime polymorphism refers to the type of Polymorphism in OOPs, by which the actual implementation of the function is decided 
during the runtime or execution. The dynamic or runtime polymorphism can be achieved with the help of method overriding.

What is the difference between overloading and overriding?
Overloading is a compile-time polymorphism feature in which an entity has multiple implementations with the same name.
Whereas Overriding is a runtime polymorphism feature in which an entity has the same name, but its implementation changes during execution.

What is meant by Inheritance?
In OOPs, inheritance is the mechanism by which an object or class (referred to as a child) is created using the definition of another object or class 
(referred to as a parent). Inheritance not only helps to keep the implementation simpler but also helps to facilitate code reuse.

What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is the method of hiding unnecessary details from the necessary ones. It is one of the main features of OOPs. 

What is a constructor?
Constructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The constructors serve the special purpose of initializing the objects.

What is a destructor?
Contrary to constructors, which initialize objects and specify space for them, Destructors are also special methods. 
But destructors free up the resources and memory occupied by an object. Destructors are automatically called when an object is being destroyed.

What are the various types of inheritance?
The various types of inheritance include:
Single inheritance
Multiple inheritances
Multi-level inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance
Hybrid inheritance

What is a subclass?
The subclass is an entity, which inherits from another class. It is also known as the child class.

Define a superclass?
The superclass is an entity, which allows subclasses or child classes to inherit from itself.

What is an interface?
An interface refers to a special type of class, which contains methods, but not their definition. Only the declaration of methods is allowed inside an interface.
To use an interface, you cannot create objects. Instead, you need to implement that interface and define the methods for their implementation. 

What is an abstract class?
An abstract class is a special class containing abstract methods. The significance of abstract class is that the abstract methods inside it are not implemented 
and are only declared. So as a result, when a subclass inherits the abstract class and needs to use its abstract methods, they need to define and implement them.

How is an abstract class different from an interface?
Interface and abstract classes both are special types of classes that contain only the methods declaration and not their implementation. 
The main difference between the two is that when an interface is implemented, the subclass must define all its methods and provide its implementation. 
Whereas when an abstract class is inherited, the subclass does not need to provide the definition of its abstract method, until and unless the subclass is using it.
Also, an abstract class can contain abstract methods as well as non-abstract methods.

What are access specifiers and what is their significance?
Access specifiers, as the name suggests, are a special type of keywords, which are used to control or specify the accessibility of entities 
like classes, methods, etc. Some of the access specifiers or access modifiers include “private”, “public”, etc. 
These access specifiers also play a very vital role in achieving Encapsulation - one of the major features of OOPs.

What is an exception?
An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the program.

What is meant by exception handling?
No one wants its software to fail or crash. Exceptions are the major reason for software failure. 
The exceptions can be handled in the program beforehand and prevent them from stopping. This is known as exception handling.
