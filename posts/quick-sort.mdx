```java
quickSort(arr,0,arr.length()-1);

// rule: elements on the left side of pivot should less than pivot and elements on the right side of pivot should be more than pivot.
static void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high)
    {
        if(low>=high){
            return;

        int s = low, e = high,pivot = arr[s + (e-s)/2]; // this implementation works only when we choose mid element as pivot
        while(s<=e){
            while(arr[s] < pivot)   s++; // gives index of element which is greater than pivot and which is on the left side of pivot
            while(arr[e] > pivot)   e--;  // gives index of element which is less than pivot and which is on the right side of pivot
            if(s <= e){          // here we swap those two elements which violate our rule
                int temp = arr[s];
