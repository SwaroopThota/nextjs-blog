What is React?
React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces
specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI)
components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.
The important features of React are:
- It supports server-side rendering.
- It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than the real DOM.
- It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.

What are the features of React?
- JSX:  JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX,
we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.
- Components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. 
It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately.
- Virtual DOM: React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. 
When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.
- High performance: React updates only those components that have changed, rather than updating all the components at once.
This results in much faster web applications.

What are the limitations of React?
The few limitations of React are as given below:
- React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.
- The components of React are numerous and will take time to fully grasp the benefits of all.
- It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.
- Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.

Can web browsers read JSX directly? 
Web browsers cannot read JSX directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects. 
For a web browser to read a JSX file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel

What is virtual DOM?
The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree structure. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, 
and each node contains objects. React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, 
and that is known as the virtual DOM. 
When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.

Why use React instead of other frameworks, like Angular?
- Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because 
it provides less coding and provides more functionality.
- Improved performance: React uses virtual DOM, which makes web applications perform faster. 
Virtual DOM compares its previous state and updates only those components in the real DOM, 
whose states have changed, rather than updating all the components.
- Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually
consists of multiple components. These components have their own logic and controls, and they can be reused
through the application,
which, in turn, dramatically reduces the development time of an application.

Why is there a need for using keys in Lists?
Keys are very important in lists for the following reasons:
A key is a unique identifier and it is used to identify which items have changed, been updated or deleted from the lists
It also helps to determine which components need to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering all the components every time.
Therefore, it increases performance, as only the updated components are re-rendered

What are the components in React?
Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. 
A component is essentially a piece of the user interface. It splits the user interface into independent,
reusable parts that can be processed separately.
There are two types of components in React:
- Functional Components: These types of components have no state of their own and only contain render methods, 
and therefore are also called stateless components. They may derive data from other components as props (properties).
- Class Components: These types of components can hold and manage their own state and have a separate render method
 to return JSX on the screen. They are also called Stateful components as they can have a state.

What is a state in React?
The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.
The state in a component can change over time, and whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

What are props in React?
Props are short for Properties. It is a React built-in object that stores the value of attributes of a tag 
and works similarly to HTML attributes.
Props provide a way to pass data from one component to another component.
Props are passed to the component in the same way as arguments are passed in a function.

What are the differences between state and props?
                                                                                  State                                                             Props

Use                                      Holds information about the components                     Allows to pass data from one component 
                                                                                                                     to other components as an argument

Mutability                           Is mutable                                                                         Are immutable

Read-Only                          Can be changed                                                                Are read-only

Child components             Child components cannot access                                      Child components can access 

Stateless components        Cannot have state                                                             Can have props

What is prop drilling in React?
Sometimes while developing React applications, there is a need to pass data from a component that is
higher in the hierarchy to a component that is deeply nested. To pass data between such components,
we pass props from a source component and keep passing the prop to the next component 
in the hierarchy till we reach the deeply nested component.
The disadvantage of using prop drilling is that the components that should otherwise be not aware of the data have access to the data.

What is a higher-order component in React?
A higher-order component acts as a container for other components. This helps to keep components simple and enables re-usability.
They are generally used when multiple components have to use a common logic. 

What are the differences between class and functional components?
                                                             Class Components                                 Functional Components

State                                                Can hold or manage state                                    Cannot hold or manage state

Simplicity                                        Complex as compared to the stateless component        Simple and easy to understand

Lifecycle methods                          Can work with all lifecycle methods                            Do not work with any lifecycle method

Reusability                                     Can be reused                                                                 Cannot be reused

What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?
There are four different phases in the lifecycle of React component. They are:
- Initialization: During this phase, React component will prepare by setting up the default props and initial state
for the upcoming tough journey.
- Mounting: Mounting refers to putting the elements into the browser DOM. Since React uses VirtualDOM,
the entire browser DOM which has been currently rendered would not be refreshed.
This phase includes the lifecycle methods componentWillMount and componentDidMount.
- Updating: In this phase, a component will be updated when there is a change in the state or props of a component.
This phase will have lifecycle methods like componentWillUpdate, shouldComponentUpdate, render, and componentDidUpdate.
- Unmounting: In this last phase of the component lifecycle, the component will be removed from the DOM
or will be unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase will have the lifecycle method named componentWillUnmount.

Explain the lifecycle methods of components.
- getInitialState(): This is executed before the creation of the component.
- componentDidMount(): Is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM.
- shouldComponentUpdate(): Is invoked when a component determines changes to the DOM 
and returns a “true” or “false” value based on certain conditions.
- componentDidUpdate(): Is invoked immediately after rendering takes place.
- componentWillUnmount(): Is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently.

What are React Hooks?
React Hooks are the built-in functions that permit developers for using the state and lifecycle methods within React components.
Hooks are functions that let us “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from a functional component.
React Hooks cannot be used in class components. They let us write components without class.

What is the use of useEffect React Hooks?
The useEffect React Hook is used for performing the side effects in functional components. 
With the help of useEffect, you will inform React that your component requires something 
to be done after rendering the component or after a state change. The function you have passed 
will be remembered by React and call afterwards the performance of DOM updates is over.
The useEffect React Hook will accept 2 arguments: useEffect(callback[, dependencies]);

What is useState() in React?
The useState() is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in functional components.
It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.
In the below-given example code, The useState(0) will return a tuple where the count is the first parameter 
that represents the counter’s current state and the second parameter setCounter method will allow us 
to update the state of the counter.
const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);

Explain about types of Hooks in React.
There are two types of Hooks in React. They are:
1. Built-in Hooks: The built-in Hooks are divided into 2 parts as given below:
- useState(): This functional component is used to set and retrieve the state.
- useEffect(): It enables for performing the side effects in the functional components.
- useContext(): It is used for creating common data that is to be accessed by the components hierarchy 
without having to pass the props down to each level.
Additional Hooks:
 - useReducer(): It is used when there is a complex state logic that is having several sub-values 
or when the upcoming state is dependent on the previous state.
- useMemo(): This will be used for recomputing the memoized value when there is a change in one of the dependencies. 
- useRef(): It will permit creating a reference to the DOM element directly within the functional component.
- useLayoutEffect(): It is used for the reading layout from the DOM and re-rendering synchronously.

What is Redux?
Redux is an open-source, JavaScript library used to manage the application state.
React uses Redux to build the user interface. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications 
and is used for the entire application’s state management.

What are the components of Redux?
- Store: Holds the state of the application.
- Action: The source information for the store.
- Reducer: Specifies how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
