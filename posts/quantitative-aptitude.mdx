- Simple Interest - (P*T*R)/100
Total amount to be paid for a compound interest of R, A = P*(1+R/100)^T
Compound Interest, CI =  A - P
Diff b/w CI and SI = ((P*(1+R/100)^T) - P) - (P*T*R)/100
For 1 year = 0
for 2 years = P*(R/100)^2
for 3 years = P(R/100)^3 + 2*P*(R/100)^2

- Work =  Number of days (Time taken) (T or D) × Number of men (M). In other words, W = D × M.
Suppose w1 is the work done in the first case and w2 in the second case. Then the ratio is equal to w1/w2 = (T1 × N1)/(T2 × N2)
work done per day by one person or efficiency of one person = 1/n.

A and B can do a job in 8 days. B and C can do the same job in 12 days. When A, B, and C work together, they can do the same job in 6 days. In how many days can A and C complete this job?
Answer: As per the question we have:
The combined efficiency of A and B is = (A+B’s) efficiency = 12.5%
Also, we have: B+C’s efficiency = 8.33%
And A+B+C’s efficiency = 16.66%
Now we need to find A + C. Let us see how to solve this:
Consider, the expression 2(A+B+C), we can write it as = (A+B) + (B+C) + (C+A)

Efficiency Ratio – Work and Time: - https://www.toppr.com/guides/quantitative-aptitude/work-and-time/efficiency-and-ratios/
If A is thrice as good a workman as B, then:
The ratio of work done by A and B = 3: 1.
The ratio of times taken by A and B to finish a work = 1 : 3. This means that if someone says A is ‘x’ times as good a workman as B, then he will take the time for B to do the same work.

- River Speed - v km/hr, Boat speed - u km/hr
upstream speed - (u+v) km/hr
downstream speed - (u-v) km/hr
river speed - (us+ds)/2
avg. speed going downstream a distance and coming back - 2uv/(u+v)

- Let us say that an inlet pipe takes ‘x’ hours to fill up a tank of some volume. Then portion or the part of the tank that the inlet pipe fills in 1 hr = 1/x units or parts
Now that we know that, we can move on to another important concept. Let us say that there are two inlet pipes and three outlet pipes. Then how would we calculate the rate at which a certain volume of the tank will be filled up? The answer is below:
Net Work Done = (Sum of work done by inlet pipes) – (Sum of work done by outlet pipes)
Some Tips and Tricks
1. If two pipes take ‘x’ & ‘y’ hr respectively to fill a tank or a reservoir or any container, and there is a third pipe that takes ‘z’ hr to empty the same container, tank or reservoir, and all of them are opened together then: The net part filled in 1hr = (1/x) + (1/y) – (1/z).
Hence, The time it takes to fill the tank = [ 1/(1/x) + (1/y) – (1/z)]
2. The leakage case: Consider a pipe that fills the tank in ‘x’ hrs. If there is a leakage in the bottom, the tank is filled in ‘y’ hrs. If the tank is full, the time taken by the leak to empty the tank =[1/(1/x) – (1/y)] hr
3. Suppose two pipes can fill an empty reservoir in t1 and t2 min respectively. If both the pipes are opened simultaneously then the time after which the second pipe is closed so that the total time taken to fill the reservoir is T min, is given by (1 + T / t1) t2 min.
