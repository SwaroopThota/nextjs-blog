```java
// Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.
// The College library has N bags, and the ith book has A[i] number of pages.
// You have to allocate books to B number of students so that the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimum.
// A book will be allocated to exactly one student.
// Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
// Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.
// Calculate and return that minimum possible number.
// NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.
