```java
// Given a set of N intervals denoted by 2D array A of size N x 2, 
// the task is to find the length of the maximal set of mutually disjoint intervals. 
// Two intervals [x, y] & [p, q] are said to be disjoint if they do not have any point in common.
// Return an integer denoting the length of the maximal set of mutually disjoint intervals.

//Eg : A = [ [1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 6], [8, 9] ] => 3 ( [[2, 3], [4, 6], [8, 9]] )

public class Solution {
    public int solve(int[][] A) {
        // sort the matrix w.r.t end points in ascending order
        // we sorting w.r.t end points or end time, to get the task that will be finished first
        // and we go on pick the task that will be finished first
        Arrays.sort(A, new Comparator<int[]>(){
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b){
                return a[1] - b[1];

        // or
        Arrays.sort(A, (o1,o2) -> Integer.compare(o1[1],o2[1]));

        // the 1st set is always included
        int prevRightEnd = A[0][1], cnt = 1;
        // sysout(prev) -> for printing

            int curRightEnd = A[i][1];
            // curr left > prev right => both sets are disjoint Eg: prev-(1,2) cur-(3,4)
